# exliquid_cql
This repository contains
* example data for Exliquid used for updating the library and measure (exliquid_example_bundle.json)
* the updated library which implements the (new?) logic which takes into account only primary samples having at least one aliquot with rest amount > 0 (and thus having at least one aliquot group)
* the measure which needed to be adapted accordingly (Measure-dashboard_original.json)
* an example measure report
